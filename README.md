👋 Hi, I’m @greim.

👀 I’m interested in full-stack development using TypeScript.

🌱 I’m currently learning Elm, Rust and Deno.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ways to promote better architectural patterns in TypeScript development. TS is great for structured development, but since it originates from the untyped and amorphous world of JavaScript, there's little consensus on how TS apps should be put together, outside the opinions of whatever framework you're using. By default, devs either revert to old JS patterns, or they look outside the TS community to find inspiration. I wish there was a repository of general TS architecture knowledge.
