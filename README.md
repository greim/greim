👋 Hi, I’m @greim.

👀 I’m interested in full-stack development using TypeScript.

🌱 I’m currently learning Elm, Rust and Deno.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ways to promote better architectural patterns in TypeScript development. TS is great for structured development, but since it originates from the Mad-Max world of JavaScript, there's little consensus on how TS apps should be put together. By default, devs either use old JS patterns, or look outside the TS community to find this sort of information.

📫 Reach me via this GitHub profile :)
